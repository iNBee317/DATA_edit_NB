Not sure what's in columns 5-6, 10-11, etc; but I found these answers via much testing a long time ago.

If a value is 100000, that means "missing value"

The XYZ coordinates are only defined once per subject, so they are in absolute rather than hand-centered coordinates.
X: forward/back. +X direction is forward (toward the cube) with the right hand, whereas -X is forward with the left hand.
Y: left/right. +Y direction is always toward the camera, and thus always medial.
Z: up/down. +Z is always upward.
