EPOCHS:
1) Load period.  Instruct experimenter, wait for spacebar (ITI).  Eyes closed.
2) Go cue.  Eyes open.
3) Start of movement.  Trigger by key release.  Eyes open.  Start collection. 5s

12 trial types: 3 block sizes, 2 vision states (on/off), 2 hands

3	press LH rest key
4	press RH rest key
5	lift LH rest key
6	lift RH rest key
10	start block: LH
11	start block: RH
12	start block: visible hand
13	start block: hidden hand
20	load epoch (includes signal to close eyes) 
21	load epoch: no eye-close signal (already closed)
30	error: lifted during loading/checking
31	error: no lift in 3s after stimulus
32	error: lifted wrong hand during move
33	error: lifted wrong hand during stimulus present
40	preview epoch
41	stimulus (ready) epoch
50	wait-for-reacq epoch
61	move epoch: 1cm cube = TRIGGER
62	move epoch: 2cm cube = TRIGGER
63	move epoch: 4cm cube = TRIGGER
70	wait for optotrak to reset
80	trial finished OK (will occur after correct 5 or 6)
90	confirmation epoch: experimenter confirmed
91	confirmation epoch: experimenter denied
92	confirmation epoch: experimenter aborted
93	confirmation epoch: auto-denial because trial ended before experimenter could respond
94	confirmation epoch: auto-accept because no usable prior trial
190	no confirmation epoch needed: experimenter already confirmed
191	no confirmation epoch needed: experimenter already denied
192	no confirmation epoch needed: experimenter already aborted
100	end of block
101	end of experiment
103	end due to abort
20*	counterbalance num
30*	extra trial num
4**	we had this many extra trials this block
50X	Which hand affected?  (0 = left, 1 = right)
8XXX	Pulse number X.
9XYY	start trial YY in block X (i.e., pulse number)
100XX	Subject number
1YYYY	Movement duration
